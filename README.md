## Kleinvoet

A hardware project aimed to improve on the work done in **Grootvoet**. The goal
of the project is to create a small, low-power and self contained temporally
synchronised data acquisition node. 

Each node should be able to sample from a variety of different sensor boards and
should have the ability to expand the number of channels each node has access
to. These nodes are then meant to make up a sensor network which can be
spatially separated however their samples should remain synchronised.

This project ties into the work done by RW Byker on the **Grootvoet** hardware
project.
